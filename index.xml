          Hi there I am a student in cyber security in his early twenties who one day, trying to find out in what he was interested, stumbled across the concept of captures the flags. It was not the first time I had heard about this concept, but it was the first I decided to try to solve one by myself. After a few hours struggling I finally found my first flag&amp;hellip;what a feeling!
